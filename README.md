# The MFA Simulator

This simulator website was designed to educate and inform users on Multi-Factor Authentication Methods.
It was designed to not only be a space to read about the inner workings and designs of these methods but also to experience them first hand in a safe and controlled environment.

# The MFA Assistant

The MFA Assistant is an android app designed to supplement the MFA Simulator website. It replaces the "phone screen" that is present on the tasks that require a fake phone.
